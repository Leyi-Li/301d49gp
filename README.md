## Project title
S'mores - Camping Explorer 


## Motivation
As a user, I want an all-in-one app experience to look up location and amenities for campsites in my area. 

I want intiutive results that display based on my input, with a user-friendly and easily navigable interface.

I want to see several results at a time, and be able to choose between them quickly. 

As a user, I want an interactive map with easy-to-interpret pins or icons showing the camp locations. 

As a user, I want to be able to check the weather forecast for the site that I am visiting. 

As a user, I want to see the campsite's booking availibility so I can plan my trip in advance. 


### strech goal :

As a user i would like to be able to to click a result and get details of things/events to do at that camp site.
